# Calibrating-ensemble-models in Python

**Author:**

I am Álvaro Orgaz Expósito, a data science student at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) and a statistician from UPC-UB (Barcelona, Spain).

**Abstract:** 

This repository contains some methods for calibrating Machine Learning ensemble models in Python. The aim of this project is not to optimize or overcome already implemented methods in Python libraries, but rather the aim should be understanding.

**Code:** 

The project has been developed in Python and Jupyter notebook.
